In this project we used Leaflet to overlay current USGS earthquake data (last 30 days, magnitude >=4.5) on Mapbox street and street-satellite maps, along with a second overlay showing tectonic plate boundaries (these are permanent on our timescale :)). User instructions are in the legend box. Leaflet layer controls allow toggling between the two base maps, and a choice of overlays (one, both, or neither). Popup boxes with earthquake location, time, magnitude, and depth are attached to each circular earthquake symbol. These are color-coded to indicate depth, and sized to indicate magnitude. Note that the range of magnitudes has been compressed for display purposes.

Behind the scenes, there are three main files of code: index.html to import packages, set up the webpage layout, and connect the code files; static/logic.js, which does the work of importing and parsing data, defining symbol sizes and shapes, and putting together the base and overlay layers; and static/style.css, which styles the overall map and legend layouts. static/config.js contains a Mapbox API key, which is hidden in a .gitignore file.
